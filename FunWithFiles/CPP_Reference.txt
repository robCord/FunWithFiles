Asm -  invokes the inline assembler and can appear wherever a C or C++ statement is legal
Auto - indicates automatic storage duration
Bool - type declaration of two types, true and false
Break - used to break a loop using the condition expression or conditional statements 
Case - transfer control to one or several statements
Catch - associates one ore more exception handlers with a compound statement 
Char -  type for character representation which can be most efficiently processed on the target system 
Class - If a function or a variable exists in scope with the name identical to the name of a class type, a class can be prepended to the name for disambiguation
Const - defines a variable as constant and is not prone to change 
Const_cast - converts types between types with different cv-qualifications
Continue - Causes the remaining portion of the enclosing for, while or do-while loop body to be skipped.
Default - explicitly-defaulted function definition
Delete - Destroys object(s) previously allocated by the new expression and releases obtained memory area
Do - executes a statement repeatedly
Double - double-precision floating-point type 
Dynamic_cast - Safely converts pointers and references to classes up, down, and sideways along the inheritance hierarchy.
Else - After a statement has concluded and does not reach the first specification, another statement is executed 
Enum - An enumeration is a distinct type whose value is restricted to a range of values
Explicit - contextual converted constant type of bool
Export - allows the same template to be declared, but not defined in other translation units 
Extern -  static or thread storage duration and external linkage 
False - boolean value declaring a value false 
Float - single-precision floating-point type 
For - Executes init-statement once, then executes statement and iteration_expression repeatedly, until the value of condition becomes false.
Friend - The friend declaration appears in a class body and grants a function or another class access to private and protected members of the class where the friend declaration appears.
Goto - Transfer control unconditionally 
If - conditionally executes another statement 
Inline - declare the function to be an inline function
Int - basic integer type (1 - 9)
Long - target type will have a width of at least 32 bits 
Mutable - permits modification of a class member declared mutable even when declared const 
Namespace - provide a method of preventing name conflicts in large projects 
New - creates and initializes objects with dynamic storage duration 
Operator - Customizes the C++ operators for operands of user-defined types.
Private - In a member-specification of a class/struct or union, define the accessibility of subsequent members.
Protected - members declared after the specifier have protected member access
Public - keep their member access in the derived class
Register - hints the compiler to place the object in the processors’ register 
Reinterpret_cast - converts between types by reinterpreting the underlying bit pattern
Return - terminates current function and returns a value  
Short -  will have a space of 16 bits 
Signed  - target will have signed representation
Sizeof - implementation-defined and might differ from 1
Static - static or thread storage duration and internal linkage
static_ cast - Converts between types using a combination of implicit and user-defined conversions
Struct - user-defined type 
Switch - transfer control to one or more statements 
Template - entity used to define several objects 
This - which the member function is being called 
Throw - signals a condition and executes an error handler 
True - boolean value type of true 
Try - associates one or more exception handlers 
Typedef - creates an alias that can be used anywhere
Typeid - queries information of a type 
Typename - can be used as an alternative to class to declare type template parameters and more 
Union - a special class that can only hold it’s non-static data 
Unsigned - target will have unsigned representation
Using - Introduces a name that is defined elsewhere into the declarative region where this using-declaration appears
Virtual - specifier specifies that a non-static member function is virtual and supports dynamic dispatch
Void - type with empty set of values 
Volatile - prone to change s
Wchar_t -  type for wide-character representation
While - executes a statement repeatedly until the condition becomes false, the test usually occurs before each iteration.
