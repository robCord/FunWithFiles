C++ Keywords Defined = 61:
asm -  invokes the inline assembler and can appear wherever a c or c++ statement is legal
auto - indicates automatic storage duration
bool - type declaration of two types, true and false
break - used to break a loop using the condition expression or conditional statements 
case - transfer control to one or several statements
catch - associates one ore more exception handlers with a compound statement 
char -  type for character representation which can be most efficiently processed on the target system 
class - if a function or a variable exists in scope with the name identical to the name of a class type, a class can be prepended to the name for disambiguation
const - defines a variable as constant and is not prone to change 
const_cast - converts types between types with different cv-qualifications
continue - causes the remaining portion of the enclosing for, while or do-while loop body to be skipped.
default - explicitly-defaulted function definition
delete - destroys object(s) previously allocated by the new expression and releases obtained memory area
do - executes a statement repeatedly
double - double-precision floating-point type 
dynamic_cast - safely converts pointers and references to classes up, down, and sideways along the inheritance hierarchy.
else - after a statement has concluded and does not reach the first specification, another statement is executed 
enum - an enumeration is a distinct type whose value is restricted to a range of values
explicit - contextual converted constant type of bool
export - allows the same template to be declared, but not defined in other translation units 
extern -  static or thread storage duration and external linkage 
false - boolean value declaring a value false 
float - single-precision floating-point type 
for - executes init-statement once, then executes statement and iteration_expression repeatedly, until the value of condition becomes false.
friend - the friend declaration appears in a class body and grants a function or another class access to private and protected members of the class where the friend declaration appears.
goto - transfer control unconditionally 
if - conditionally executes another statement 
inline - declare the function to be an inline function
int - basic integer type (1 - 9)
long - target type will have a width of at least 32 bits 
mutable - permits modification of a class member declared mutable even when declared const 
namespace - provide a method of preventing name conflicts in large projects 
new - creates and initializes objects with dynamic storage duration 
operator - customizes the c++ operators for operands of user-defined types.
private - in a member-specification of a class/struct or union, define the accessibility of subsequent members.
protected - members declared after the specifier have protected member access
public - keep their member access in the derived class
register - hints the compiler to place the object in the processorsâ€™ register 
reinterpret_cast - converts between types by reinterpreting the underlying bit pattern
return - terminates current function and returns a value  
short -  will have a space of 16 bits 
signed  - target will have signed representation
sizeof - implementation-defined and might differ from 1
static - static or thread storage duration and internal linkage
struct - user-defined type 
switch - transfer control to one or more statements 
template - entity used to define several objects 
this - which the member function is being called 
throw - signals a condition and executes an error handler 
true - boolean value type of true 
try - associates one or more exception handlers 
typedef - creates an alias that can be used anywhere
typeid - queries information of a type 
typename - can be used as an alternative to class to declare type template parameters and more 
unsigned - target will have unsigned representation
using - introduces a name that is defined elsewhere into the declarative region where this using-declaration appears
virtual - specifier specifies that a non-static member function is virtual and supports dynamic dispatch
void - type with empty set of values 
volatile - prone to change s
wchar_t -  type for wide-character representation
while - executes a statement repeatedly until the condition becomes false, the test usually occurs before each iteration.
